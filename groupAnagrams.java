/*

Given a list of words  print all anagrams together.

For example  if the given list of words is {but,tac,god,act, dog, cat, tub}
then output would be groups of anagrams [but,tub][tac,act,cat][god, dog]


Example:
Input=  pan nap god bat bag dog tub

Output= [pan, nap]
        [god, dog]
 

Note : 
1) Print the group of anagrams only if the size of group is more than 1
2) Order of words in output should be same as order given in input.
3) Print -1, if no group of anagrams found
